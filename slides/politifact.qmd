## Role of Fact-Checking Organizations

- Definition and role of fact-checking organizations [@amazeen2020journalistic; @graves2016]
    1. Serve as arbiters of truth in public discourse
    2. Verify authenticity of public claims

- Examples of leading fact-checking organizations
    1. Specialized in fact-checkin: *PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, Snopes*
    2. News agencies: *CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, The New York Times*

## Background of Study

- Fact-checking is effective in general: 

    - It decreases the belief on misinformation [@walter2020fact; @wood2019elusive]
    - It increases the belief on true information [@swire2020they; @swire2017processing]

- The effect is consistent:

    - Even when fact-checking contradicts previously held predispositions [i.e., party affiliation, @coppock2023conceptual]
    - Even when the source of the fact-checking is out-group organizations [@chae2023perceiving]
    
## Background of Study

- Fact-checking in a real-world context
    - Research has focused on experimental settings [e.g., @wood2019elusive; @chae2023perceiving]
    - Real-world consumption patterns insufficiently studied [exceptionally, @shin2017partisan]

- Frequency of visits to fact-checking websites
    - Direct visits to fact-checking websites are infrequent [@guess2020exposure]
    - Social media may serve as main conduit for fact-checking news like other types of news [@newman2021reuters]
    
- Role of social media in fact-checking exposure
    - Importance of indirect or incidental exposure to fact-checking [@fletcher2018people]
    - Fact-checking news dissemination within social media platforms [@bakshy2015exposure; @barbera2015tweeting]

## Role of Opinion Leaders on Social Media

- Two-step flow communication theory
    - Media messages reach public via interpersonal relationships, not directly from original sources [@katz1957two]
    - Role of "opinion leaders" who actively engage with, digest, and disseminate fact-checking news [@lazarsfeld1944people; @chadwick2011political; @kim2013stumbling]

- The two-step flow theory in the context of social media
    - Many social media users don't directly access fact-checking news, but receive it through opinion leaders [@guess2020exposure; @bode2016political]
    - Role of these leaders in creating echo chambers and ideological polarization [@bakshy2015exposure; @barbera2015social; @flaxman2016filter]
    - Illustration of two-step flow on Twitter and Facebook [@barbera2015tweeting; @wells2016coproduction]
  
## Selective Sharing Behavior on Social Media

- The role of self-presentation in social media sharing behavior [@kraft2020social; @walther1996computer; @gantz1979people]
    - News sharing as an exercise in influencing an "imagined audience" [@litt2016imagined; @litt2012knock]
    - Factors determining perceived shareworthiness of news content [@karnowski2021worth; @kumpel2015news]
    - Partisanship as a primary motivator in the context of political fact-checking news sharing

- Application of social identity theory to understand partisan behavior [@tajfel1982social; @turner1987rediscovering]
    - Partisan individuals projecting their identity onto political in-groups [@iyengar2012affect; @iyengar2019origins]
    - Preference of directional goals over accuracy in news sharing, in line with motivated reasoning principles [@kunda1990case]
  
## Research Questions
  
1. In recent years, what have been the general trends in political fact-checking, and how have the outcomes of these checks been congruent or divergent with the claims of different political parties and ideologies (**RQ1**)? 

2. Does the selective sharing of fact-checking content on social media occur in accordance with its congruence to party or ideological alignments (**RQ2**)?

3. What traits define those who frequently share political fact-checking content on social media (**RQ3**)?

## Data Collection

1. *PolitiFact* fact-checking news:
    
    - Date range: From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2021 (Two Presidential Election, One Midterm Election; $N = 9,523$)
    - Meta-data: url, date, title, author(s), adjudication, target of fact-checking, content
    - Adjudication: Pants on fire, False, Mostly False, Half True, Mostly True, True
    - Manual coding of the political affiliation/leaning of the target of fact-checking: 
        1. Liberal/Democrat
        2. Conservative/Republican
        3. Affiliation unknown/Neither of them
        4. Not political

## Data Collection

2. All Twitter posts of *PolitiFact* official Twitter account:
    
    - Among all the Tweet posts ($N = 35,965$) by *PolitiFact* during the date range, only left tweet posts about direct fact-checking toward entities with political affiliation or leaning ($N = 8,391$)
    - Meta-data: url, date, tweet, social engagement counts (i.e., the number of retweet, likes, etc.)
    
3. Ideology score of each user who retweeted the fact-checking post:

    1. \key{Retweeter list} of each Twitter post about fact-checking
        - Unique retweeter: $N = 185,765$
        - Estimate the ideal point, $\hat{\theta}_i$, for each user $i$ with their following information [@barbera2015tweeting]
    
    2. Users' ideology score collected by and calculated by [@barbera2015tweeting, until 2020, $N = 64,579,475$]
        - Sampling criteria: Randomly sample amont Twitter users who are following at least three political elites' accounts
    
    3. Leave only commonly existing samples in both dataset: $N = 153,797$  ($\approx$ 83 \% of *PolitiFact* Retweeters)

## Conclusion

1. Fact-checking verdicts tend to align more with Liberal/Democratic preferences, a trend that intensifies during election cycles, 
    - This pattern is more stark during the election period
    - Partially explains recent finding of "susceptibility of conservatives" to political misinformation [@garrett2021conservatives]
    - They take more burden cognitively to reject directional motivation when processing political misinformation

2. Majority of users sharing fact-checking posts lean towards the liberal side of the political spectrum

3. Conservative users, when sharing fact-checking posts, predominantly choose those that affirm their partisan inclinations, suggesting a strong tendency towards partisan cheerleading in their sharing practices

4. This pattern of partisan cheerleading is also pronounced among liberal users, especially during election periods.
